% Text that should not re-wrap

This is a normal line that is just long enough to reach the minimum length
and it should not be re-wrapped to maintain consistency.

This paragraph was originally written as a long one.
% However, this sentence was commented out.
So now, it should not be re-wrapped.

% Text that should re-wrap

This is a line that is not so long and continues afterwards, so it
should be re-wrapped.

This is a few short lines that should wrap into one.

This is a line with some space.
\begin{definition}
  And the \textbackslash{}begin command, or the line after it, should
  not re-wrap.
\end{definition}

Environments with items should re-wrap onto lines with items, but not re-wrap
lines from lines containing items.
\begin{itemize}
  \item This is a short line which can take more words, and they
    should be moved there, and the line should also be correctly
    indented.
  \item However, this line should not be re-wrapped onto the previous one.
\end{itemize}
