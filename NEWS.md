# v0.5.4

## Allow custom non-indented environments

- Pass `no-indent-envs = ["mydocument"]` in `tex-fmt.toml`.
- Then no indentation is applied inside `\begin{mydocument}...\end{mydocument}`.
- This is the default behaviour for `\begin{document}...\end{document}`.

## Allow custom verbatim environments

- Pass `verbatims = ["myverbatim"]` in `tex-fmt.toml`.
- All formatting is then skipped inside `\begin{myverbatim}...\end{myverbatim}`.

## Improve formatting when using `\verb|...|`

- Lines are not broken inside `\verb|...|`.
- Environments inside `\verb|...|` do not trigger new lines.
- No indenting applied to lines containing `\verb|...|`.

## Minor changes

- Fix output bug in profiling script at `extra/prof.sh`.
- Add link to [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/tex-fmt/latest/tex_fmt/) page in README.
- Add logo to [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/tex-fmt/latest/tex_fmt/) page.
- Add better tests for config file options and CLI arguments.
- Improve documentation of config file options and CLI arguments in README.

# v0.5.3

- Deploy web app for using tex-fmt in a browser.
- Simplify testing structure.
- Switch nix flake input to nixpkgs-unstable.
- Update README with GitHub Action, mason.nvim, Debian, bibtex-tidy, pre-commit.

# v0.5.2

- Fix critical bug with config files missing the `lists` field.
- Trim trailing newlines.

# v0.5.1

- Custom list environments can be passed using the `lists` option in the config file.
- Allow `verbosity = "info"` in the config file.
- Fixed a bug with configuration values being incorrectly reset.

# v0.5.0

Version v0.5.0 is a major release, including breaking changes and substantial new features.

## Changes to existing CLI options
- The option to disable line wrapping has been changed from `--keep` to `--nowrap`.
- The option to set the number of characters used per indentation level has been changed from `--tab` to `--tabsize`.
- The option to set the maximum line length for wrapping has been changed from `--wrap` to `--wraplen`.
- See below for information on the new `--config`, `--noconfig`, `--man`, `--completion`, and `--args` flags.

## Configuration file support
Configuring tex-fmt can now be achieved using a configuration file as well as CLI arguments. The configuration file can be read from a user-specified path with `--config <config>`, from the current working directory, from the root of the current git repository, or from the user's configuration directory, in order of decreasing priority. Arguments passed on the command line will always override those specified in configuration files. Configuration files can be disabled by passing `--noconfig`.

## Man pages
Man pages can be generated using the `--man` flag. Pre-built man pages are also available for download from the GitHub repository.

## Shell completion
Completion files for popular shells, including bash, fish, zsh, elvish and PowerShell, can be generated using the `--completion <SHELL>` flag. Pre-built completion scripts are also available for download from the GitHub repository.

## Minor changes
- Arguments passed to tex-fmt can be inspected by passing `--args`
- Fixed bug with `\itemsep` matching the `\item` pattern
- Added last non-indented line number to "Indent did not return to zero" error messages
- Removed LTO optimization to improve compile time with minimal effect on run time
- If duplicate file names are provided, they are now removed before formatting
- Added LLF to the list of existing tools
- Changed order of options in help dialogs

# v0.4.1

# v0.4.0

## Breaking change
The logic for line wrapping has been changed. Previously, for lines longer than
80 characters, we would break the line at suitable points into chunks of no
more than 80 characters. Then another round of indenting was applied, and this
would often push the length back over 80 characters. A subsequent round of
wrapping was therefore required, and often led to the creation of very short
lines (#6).

The new approach is to take lines longer than 80 characters and remove the
first segment up to 70 characters, pushing the resulting two lines back onto
the queue. When indenting is then reapplied, the lines typically do not go over
80 characters unless the indentation is very deep. However, some lines may now
be truncated to 70 characters rather than 80.

## Other updates

- Added a `--keep` flag to disable line wrapping (#10)
- Improved the central algorithm to avoid multiple passes and improve run-time
  performance (#7)
- Only write the file to disk if the formatting returns a different string, to
  avoid unnecessary editing of modification times
